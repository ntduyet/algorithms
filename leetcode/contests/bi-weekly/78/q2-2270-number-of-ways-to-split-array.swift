/*
- Calculate `total` denoting the sum of all elements
- Iterate over every index `i` from `0..<n - 1` and keep track `leftSum` denoting the sum of all elements from `0...i`
    - As we already know `total` and `leftSum`, we should also know `rightSum = total - leftSum`
    - If `leftSum >= rightSum`, increase the result by 1

Time complexity: O(n) where n = nums.count
Space complexity: O(n)
